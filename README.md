### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

TL;DR: Open for work. I usually understand what the client needs from a marketing standpoint and how to do it from a developer's.

Currently working on Django + Vue.js project that has grown from a simple landing page to a media publisher's main digital product with 11k users over the course of 1.5 years.

### Skills
Python, Django, Vue.js, REST API, Digital marketing, Full-stack web development, UX/UI, Docker, Git, Team management

## History
After getting a masterâ€™s degree in marketing, started my career as an in-house digital marketing manager in a newspaper publisher. Later was assigned to coordinate the development of the same companyâ€™s new online media website and given a team of 3. Soon enough started coding some stuff myself to speed up the process and protect my team from distractions. Then switched to freelance full-stack development with Python, Django and Vue.js.

### Timeline
#### 2014 â€“ 2016
Almost single-handedly built digital marketing from scratch: refreshed old siteâ€™s design, added user registration, integrated email marketing service (forms, triggers, mail templates, etc.), made technical SEO and started social media accounts.

#### 2016 â€“ 2018
Was assigned to coordinate the process of developing the new companyâ€™s website with digital media with a team of 3. I was researching tools and frameworks offered by devs to clarify that they fit our goals at first and then to set tasks as precisely as possible. Then started coding myself to speed things up and ensure my team can work on core tasks.

#### 2018 â€“ now
Freelancing as a full-stack web developer primarily on Django + Vue.js
